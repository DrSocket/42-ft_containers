# ft_containers

The purpose of this project is to implement a few containers of the C++ Standard Library.

In this project I implemented the following containers:
`vector`
`map`
`stack`
`set`

For map and set I implemented a Red Black tree.
I compared the performance, timing was <= the STL containers in every test case.

## Usage

Running `$ make` will compile 2 binaries, the std_containers containing the test files with the STL containers and ft_containers containing the same test files with my implementation.
